            <p>
              Last year, on the heels of the Create Conference,
              you were asked to submit your own Create Plan by covering 6 topics together
              meant to define the offensive game plan of your office.
              The format was quite rigid and maybe the questions were not as
              forward-looking as they should have been.
            </p>
            <p>
              This year, along with the Initial Profit Plan for which you will receive
              separated instructions, we would like you to go back to the 6 topics and tell
              us for each of them what is it that you want to do in 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are no sections anymore. Only the chance to tell us what truly
              matters to you and what you envision in the future for each of the 6 pillars.
            </p>

              As you will start to will in the plan for your office, you will see the
              first question should be considered as the "elevator pitch" of your ambition.
              What are the biggest decisions I want to make in 2014?
              How will we succeed? How will we measure success?
            </p>
